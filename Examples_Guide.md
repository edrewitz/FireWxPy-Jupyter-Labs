# FireWxPy Jupyter Lab Tutorials Landing Page

Here are several tutorials on how users will be able to use FireWxPy to make customized weather graphics with a focus on fire weather while having MINIMAL coding proficiency. My motto is: "I want my software to do all the work so you don't have to!"

In FireWxPy users can make graphics in the following categories: NWS Forecasts, Real Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA), 
Observed Soundings and Daily Weather Summaries for the previous day for an ASOS. 

These functions download the data, unpack, parse and plot the data automatically. These functions also build the directory that hosts the images and downloads, unzips and files the .SHP files and their components to where they need to go. That is the beauty of FireWxPy, it requires MINIMAL work on the part of the user (remember my motto!). 

If users wish to download and create a lot of graphics at once, the recommended way is to download the data outside of the 
plotting function and pass it into the plotting function. The plotting function will do all the rest of the work such as
parsing the data, plotting the data and building the branches of the directory if the user adds a new FireWxPy function to the
script they are running.
